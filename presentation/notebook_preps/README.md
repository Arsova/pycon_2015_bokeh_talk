The ipyton notebook "Slides - test.ipynb" uses nbextensions "rise" & "hideinput" as well as some custom css and font awesome.

The notebooks "Presentation skeleton *" all need to be moved into the washmap directory to be run. And can be accessed from there
using the comment:

./manage.py shell_plus --notebook

(you will need django extensions)
